  <p align="center">In the summer of 2013 my sister's now husband texts me and asks if I had 2 weeks free. Confused I answered with a "yes". Turns out it he was bored and wanted to do a cross country trip from New Jersey to California.Less than 2 days later we were packed and ready to go. The first half of the trip took us through the northern part of the US. We decided to spend the nights camping in national parks or camping sites. It worked out most of the time. After about a week on the road we made it to Truckee,California. We headed down to San Francisco to visit <a href="https://www.amoeba.com/"> SF Amoeba</a> music store since the friends I traveled with were hell bent on visiting that store. We drove down the Pacific coast highway, visited some friends that lived around the  area and finally headed to Yosemite. This is where the story of us almost dying begins. </p>
  <p align="center"> We decided to see Yosemite for a brief moment as we were running out of time. We arrived at the park around noon, plenty of time to see the views, we thought. We managed to find a parking space (its surprising how crowded the tourist center of the place can be) and  decided to take some pictures and just stretch our legs. As we walked to the visitor center we looked at some of trail maps. Now, all three of us are self proclaimed weekend warriors and hiking long and difficult trails was nothing out of the ordinary for us. We decided we had enough time to do one of the short hikes, we chose the <a href="http://www.yosemitehikes.com/yosemite-valley/mist-trail/mist-trail.htm"> the mist trail.</a> We headed back to the car for some basic hiking supplies. Our combined supplies yielded the following:</p>

    <p>Looking at those supplies one can only think the height of youthful <i>hubris</i> was real on this day. The hike and the views did not disappoint. We encountered countless of suspiciously friendly squirrels. Anyways,we made it to the top and the views were surreal. Nothing like the views we've seen in the tri-state area. At that point it was about 5 pm. We ravaged through our bountiful food supply in the first hour and we were down to only our water bottles.Still, we did not see a problem with the situation yet. We noticed less and less people around us. We figured we would make it  back to the car before sunset and be on our way out of the park. We were wrong. We were a little confused as to which route to take back to get back to the visitor center but after a while we found the trail, no sweat. We climbed down as fast as we could, we noticed the trail zig-zagged for the most part. We were running out of time so we decided to cut through and managed to get back on what appeared to be a trail. At this point it had been about 45 minutes since we saw anyone else. We did see some warning signs about big cats being active at dusk, that was comforting. With the sun setting and us wandering around without a map, hoping we were in the right trail, we didn't speak much with the occasional joke as an attempt to lift the spirits. It was now dusk, we were exhausted, hungry, and worried we weren't going to make it back before nightfall. With each passing minute our hope evaporated and our anguish grew. We decided not to stop and continue while hoping for the best when we came to a fork on the trail and coming towards us was a couple, we must have looked like a hot mess to compel them to come close to us and ask us if we needed assistance. They told us they were headed to their campsite but it was in the general area of where we were heading. Long story short, we made it back to the car past 9. At that point we were looking for any scrap of food, while walking with the couple we also found out one needs to book a camping site with weeks if not months in advanced. Knowing we couldn't stay the night or find anything to eat we decided to move along to the nearest town which was over an hour away.</p>
